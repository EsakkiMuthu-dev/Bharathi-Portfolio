                          Despite the interconnectedness provided by smartphones
                          and social media, many individuals still experience
                          profound feelings of
                          <strong>loneliness and disconnection</strong>, leading
                          to increased anxiety and depression.

                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <p class="mb-30">
                          Develop a mobile support app that facilitates
                          connections between

                          <strong>anonymity</strong>

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          After connecting with several users, I discovered
                          <strong>significant insights </strong> that informed
                          the <strong> direction of the app</strong>:
                        </p>

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          <strong> 1. Need for Meaningful Connection: </strong>
                          Users expressed dissatisfaction with existing social
                          media platforms, which often prioritize short-term
                          entertainment content and lack genuine connections.
                          The prevalence of fake comments and negativity further
                          exacerbates feelings of loneliness and depression.

                          privacy, and easy access to support resources. By
                          addressing these needs, we aim to empower individuals
                          to seek the support they need in times of distress.

                        <h3>Avoiding featurism and prioritizing user needs</h3>

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          From my research, I found that
                          <strong>privacy</strong> is a major concern for
                          individuals when sharing personal information that
                          they don't disclose to others, as highlighted by my
                          friend Esakki Muthu. Additionally, our app should
                          strive to minimize distractions, as mentioned by my
                          sister. Therefore, it's crucial to avoid unnecessary
                          features to maintain a
                          <strong>distraction-free environment.</strong>
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          Furthermore, not everyone is comfortable with chat
                          support, so incorporating call and group
                          <strong>call support </strong>is essential to cater to
                          diverse user preferences. By prioritizing user needs
                          over feature overload, we ensure a seamless and
                          user-friendly experience for all.
